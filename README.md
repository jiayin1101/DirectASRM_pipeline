# DirectASRM human demonstration pipeline

This repository provides a publication-ready demonstration of the computational pipeline used in **DirectASRM: Uncovering allele-specific post-transcriptional RNA modifications through direct RNA sequencing**.

The scripts document the main analysis steps used to construct the DirectASRM resource. They are written as clear step-by-step shell scripts rather than as a fully automated workflow. This repository focuses on the **human pipeline**. The DirectASRM database contains multiple species; adapting this workflow to other species or genome builds may require minor changes to the reference genome, transcriptome FASTA, GTF/GFF annotation, coordinate-conversion step, and species-specific genome resources.

## Input files

For a small human demonstration run, place files as follows:

```text
data/demo_fast5/sample_fast5_files/
data/reference/hg38.fa
data/reference/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.cdna.all.fa
data/reference/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.gtf
```

The demo FAST5 files should be small enough for distribution. For GitHub, we recommend keeping the FAST5 demo set around **10–50 MB**, preferably below **100 MB**. Larger FAST5/reference files should be deposited in Zenodo, Figshare, or GitHub Releases and linked from this README.

## Configure paths

Edit:

```bash
config/config.sh
```

Tool names are called directly as `minimap2`, `samtools`, `longshot`, `nanopolish`, `m6anet`, and `xpore`, assuming they are available in the active environment.

## Run the human demonstration pipeline

```bash
bash scripts/run_human_demo.sh
```

Or run each step manually:

```bash
bash scripts/01_basecalling.sh
bash scripts/02_genome_alignment_and_variant_calling.sh
bash scripts/03_vcf_genome_to_transcriptome.sh
bash scripts/04_mask_reference_and_realign.sh
bash scripts/05_allele_assignment.sh
bash scripts/06_nanopolish_eventalign_and_m6anet.sh
bash scripts/07_xpore_diffmod.sh
```

## Notes

- This repository provides a transparent implementation of the human DirectASRM analysis pipeline for publication and review.
- The scripts are not cluster-specific and contain no SLURM/SBATCH directives.
- The scripts do not contain local absolute paths.
- The human coordinate conversion script uses `BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38` and `TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38.knownGene` by default.
- For other species or genome builds, users should modify the reference genome, transcriptome reference, annotation, and coordinate-conversion logic accordingly.

## Archival DOI

For manuscript submission, the GitHub repository should be accompanied by an archived snapshot with a DOI, for example through Zenodo or Figshare.
